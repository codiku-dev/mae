**TypeScript Tapestry**\n=====================\n\nIn realms of code, where types reign,\nA language born, with precision gained.\n\n`interface User {`\n `name: string;`\n `age: number;`\n`}`\n\nWith interfaces, we define what's true,\nAnd TypeScript guides us, with a gentle clue.\n\n`typescript\ntype Point = [number, number];\n`\n\nFunctions too, get type-safe care,\nNo more runtime errors, to share.\n\n`function add(a: number, b: number): number {`\n `return a + b;`\n`}`\n\nType inference, a feature so grand,\nSaves us time, with a thoughtful hand.\n\n`const user: User = { name: 'John', age: 30 };`\n\nIn this tapestry, of TypeScript might,\nWe weave a fabric, of strong and safe code in sight.
